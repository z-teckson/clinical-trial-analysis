# Preliminary Findings: Aversionex Clinical Trial

## Overview
This document summarizes the initial analysis of the Aversionex clinical trial data. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Aversionex in reducing alcohol consumption among patients with alcohol dependence.

## Data Summary
- Number of patients: 100 (simulated data)
- Treatment period: 30 days before and after intervention
- Primary outcome: Mean number of drinks per day

## Mean Drinks Analysis
The mean number of drinks per day was calculated for the 30‑day period prior to treatment and the 30‑day period following treatment.

- **Mean drinks before treatment:** 9.52 (simulated)
- **Mean drinks after treatment:** 7.23 (simulated)

The observed reduction suggests a positive trend, but further statistical testing is required to determine whether the change is statistically significant.

## Heavy Drinking Episode Analysis
Heavy drinking episodes are defined as consuming ≥5 drinks for men or ≥4 drinks for women on a single day. This metric is a crucial indicator of treatment efficacy because heavy drinking days are strongly associated with relapse risk, alcohol‑related harm, and poor long‑term outcomes.

Using the simulated trial data, we calculated the percentage of patients who experienced at least one heavy drinking episode in the 30‑day periods before and after treatment.

- **Patients with ≥1 heavy drinking episode before treatment:** 78 (78%)
- **Patients with ≥1 heavy drinking episode after treatment:** 42 (42%)
- **Absolute reduction:** 36 percentage points

The substantial decrease in the proportion of patients experiencing heavy drinking episodes suggests that Aversionex may be effective in reducing harmful drinking patterns. This finding aligns with the reduction in mean daily consumption and supports the potential clinical benefit of the intervention.

## Limitations
1. ~~The current analysis only considers average consumption. Heavy drinking episodes, a key predictor of relapse and harm, are not yet examined.~~ **Addressed**
2. Patient‑reported craving scores have not been analyzed.
3. The data used here are simulated; actual trial data will be incorporated in the next iteration.

## Next Steps
1. ~~Implement analysis of heavy drinking episodes (≥5 drinks for men, ≥4 drinks for women on a single day).~~ **Completed**
2. Incorporate craving score analysis to assess subjective urge to drink.
3. Perform inferential statistics (e.g., paired t‑test, mixed‑effects models) to quantify treatment effects.
